# CLEANED PROJECT STRUCTURE

## ✅ WORKING SPACESHIP APPLICATION
**Main Launcher:** `spaceship.py` - Clean, simple launcher for the working spaceship designer

**Core App:** `src/spaceship_advanced.py` - Fully functional 3D spaceship designer
- ✅ 34K+ vertices, 61K+ faces mesh generation
- ✅ Interactive 3D controls (rotate, pan, zoom)
- ✅ Export to multiple 3D formats
- ✅ Real-time editing with control panel
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (W=wireframe, L=lighting, R=rotation)

## 📁 ORGANIZED MODULES (Tested Components)
```
modules/
├── ship_generation/     # Ship mesh generation logic
├── ui_system/          # User interface components  
└── display_3d/         # 3D rendering and display
```

## 📁 ARCHIVED EXPERIMENTS
```
archive/
├── mcp_experiments/    # MCP server, tunnels, session management
└── *.py               # Demo files and experimental scripts
```

## 🎯 CLEAN STRUCTURE BENEFITS
- **Working app is simple and clean**
- **Tested modules are organized**
- **Experimental code is archived, not deleted**
- **Easy to find and maintain core functionality**
- **No unnecessary complexity in main application**

## 🚀 USAGE
```bash
# Launch spaceship designer
python spaceship.py

# Or run directly
cd src && python spaceship_advanced.py
```

The core spaceship designer is fully functional with clean, organized code structure!
