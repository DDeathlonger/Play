## Key Performance Metrics (Validated Oct 28, 2025)

### Optimized Version Performance
```
Mesh Generation: 30k+ vertices/sec
Primitive Creation: 76k+ primitives/sec (cylinders)
Memory Usage: ~40MB (vs 80MB legacy)
Startup Time: ~0.5 seconds (vs 2-3s legacy)
Default Mesh: 424 vertices, 736 faces (vs 33k+ vertices legacy)
```

### GPU Acceleration
- Automatic detection of hardware vs software rendering
- Optimized OpenGL vertex arrays for performance
- Reduced polygon count (8-section vs 32-section primitives)

## Architecture Decisions

### Modular Design
1. **Separation of Concerns**: UI, logic, and utilities are separate
2. **Shared Components**: Common functionality in spaceship_utils.py
3. **Performance Focus**: Reduced complexity for better responsiveness
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new primitive types and features

### VS Code Integration
1. **Launch Configurations**: F5 debugging for all app variants
2. **Task Definitions**: Ctrl+Shift+P task runner integration  
3. **IntelliSense**: Full Python language support with Pylance
4. **Environment**: Automatic virtual environment activation

- ✅ **Organized**: Logical file structure with proper imports

## AI Iteration Guidelines

### ALWAYS Check These First
1. **File Structure**: Verify current organization in src/, tests/, examples/, exports/
2. **Import Paths**: Use relative imports within src/ package (from .module import)
3. **VS Code Config**: Check .vscode/ for current launch/task configurations
4. **Performance Impact**: Consider performance implications of any changes
5. **Compatibility**: Ensure changes work with both optimized and legacy versions

### Key Context Files
1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Architecture and development patterns
2. `references/ai-context/` - Current project state and decisions
3. `references/flowcharts/` - Visual process documentation
4. `README.md` - User-facing documentation and quick start
5. `VSCODE_GUIDE.md` - VS Code integration instructions

### Development Workflow
1. **Start**: Check current context in references/ai-context/
2. **Code**: Make changes with performance and modularity in mind
3. **Test**: Use VS Code tasks or F5 debugging to validate
4. **Update**: Refresh AI context documentation after significant changes
